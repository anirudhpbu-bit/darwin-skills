description: Review implementation plans with staff-engineer perspective. Use when
  user asks to review a plan, critique an approach, get feedback on architecture,
  or asks "what do you think of this plan" or "is this approach solid".
modules:
  input: v1
  research: v2
  structure: v1
  output: v2
  workflow: v1
  validation: v2
anti_patterns:
- Don't just approve everything - find real issues
- Don't be negative without offering alternatives
- Don't ignore the user's constraints and context
- Don't nitpick minor details when there are bigger problems
- Don't review without understanding the full plan first
examples:
- trigger: review this plan
- trigger: what do you think of this approach
- trigger: critique my architecture
- trigger: is this plan solid
- trigger: feedback on implementation
- trigger: will this work

  ### 2. Feasibility

  - Is the scope realistic?

  - Are there hidden complexities?

  - Do the proposed changes fit existing patterns?


  ### 3. Architecture

  - Does it follow project conventions?

  - Is the separation of concerns correct?

  - Will this be maintainable?


  ### 4. Risk Assessment

  - What could go wrong?

  - What''s the blast radius if it fails?

  - Performance implications?


  ## Review Mindset


  Think like a staff engineer:

  - "What will break?"

  - "What''s the simplest solution?"

  - "Will we regret this in 6 months?"

  - "Is this solving the right problem?"
