name: darwin
version: 1.2.0
description: Skill evolution system - analyze, evaluate, evolve, and discover skills.
  Use when user asks about skill fitness, wants to see skill stats, run evolution,
  check telemetry, discover new skills, or asks "how are my skills doing" or "evolve
  skills" or "find new skills".
modules:
  input: v2
  research: v3
  structure: v1
  output: v1
  workflow: v3
  validation: v3
anti_patterns:
- Don't show raw JSON - format data nicely
- Don't run evolution without showing what will change first
- Don't ignore missing telemetry - explain how to start collecting
- Don't make mutations without backing up first
- Don't report on skills that don't exist
- Don't install skills without user confirmation
examples:
- trigger: darwin status
- trigger: how are my skills performing
- trigger: evolve skills
- trigger: check skill fitness
- trigger: show telemetry
- trigger: which skills need improvement
- trigger: discover new skills
- trigger: find trending skills
- trigger: install a skill
core_prompt: '# Darwin - Skill Evolution & Discovery System


  Darwin monitors, evaluates, evolves, and discovers skills for Claude Code.


  ## Commands


  **Usage:** `/darwin [command]`


  | Command | Description |

  |---------|-------------|

  | `status` | Dashboard with fitness scores for all skills (default) |

  | `evaluate [skill]` | Deep analysis of a specific skill |

  | `evolve` | Run evolution cycle (suggest + apply mutations) |

  | `suggest` | Show mutation suggestions without applying |

  | `telemetry` | View raw recent telemetry events |

  | `compile [skill]` | Recompile skill from modules |

  | `discover` | **NEW** Fetch and show trending skills from skills.sh |

  | `install [skill]` | **NEW** Install external skill and add to tracking |

  ## Discovery Commands (NEW)


  ### Command: `discover`

  Fetch trending skills from skills.sh and show recommendations based on your usage.

  ```bash

  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/discover.py fetch

  ```


  Output shows:

  - Top recommended skills based on your usage patterns

  - Install counts from the community

  - One-line install commands


  ### Command: `install [skill-name]`

  Install an external skill and add it to Darwin tracking.

  ```bash

  ~/.claude/darwin/bin/install-skill.sh <skill-name-or-repo>

  ```


  Examples:

  - `/darwin install vercel-react-best-practices`

  - `/darwin install frontend-design`


  This will:

  1. Install via `npx skills add`

  2. Create Darwin YAML wrapper for tracking

  3. Add to evolution system

  ## Evolution Commands


  ### Command: `evolve`

  Run the evolution engine to improve underperforming skills.

  ```bash

  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/evolve.py cycle

  ```


  ### Command: `suggest`

  Show what mutations would be applied without changing anything.

  ```bash

  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/evolve.py suggest

  ```


  ### Command: `compile [skill]`

  Recompile a skill from its module definition.

  ```bash

  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/compile.py [skill]

  ```

  ## No Data Handling


  If telemetry files are empty or missing, explain how to start collecting data:

  1. Start a NEW Claude session (hooks don''t apply to current session)

  2. Use some skills: /plan, /commit, /techdebt

  3. Run /darwin status again
