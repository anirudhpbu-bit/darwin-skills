name: darwin
version: 1.1.0
description: Skill evolution system - analyze, evaluate, and evolve skills. Use when
  user asks about skill fitness, wants to see skill stats, run evolution, check telemetry,
  or asks "how are my skills doing" or "evolve skills".
modules:
  input: v2
  research: v3
  structure: v1
  output: v1
  workflow: v3
  validation: v3
anti_patterns:
- Don't show raw JSON - format data nicely
- Don't run evolution without showing what will change first
- Don't ignore missing telemetry - explain how to start collecting
- Don't make mutations without backing up first
- Don't report on skills that don't exist
examples:
- trigger: darwin status
- trigger: how are my skills performing
- trigger: evolve skills
- trigger: check skill fitness
- trigger: show telemetry
- trigger: which skills need improvement
core_prompt: '# Darwin - Skill Evolution System


  Darwin monitors, evaluates, and evolves your Claude Code skills over time.


  ## Commands


  **Usage:** `/darwin [command]`


  | Command | Description |

  |---------|-------------|

  | `status` | Dashboard with fitness scores for all skills (default) |

  | `evaluate [skill]` | Deep analysis of a specific skill |

  | `evolve` | Run evolution cycle (suggest + apply mutations) |

  | `suggest` | Show mutation suggestions without applying |

  | `telemetry` | View raw recent telemetry events |

  | `compile [skill]` | Recompile skill from modules |


  ## Evolution Commands


  ### Command: `evolve`

  Run the evolution engine to improve underperforming skills.

  ```bash

  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/evolve.py cycle

  ```


  ### Command: `suggest`

  Show what mutations would be applied without changing anything.

  ```bash

  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/evolve.py suggest

  ```


  ### Command: `compile [skill]`

  Recompile a skill from its module definition.

  ```bash

  python3 ~/.claude/darwin/bin/compile.py [skill]

  ```


  ## No Data Handling


  If telemetry files are empty or missing, explain how to start collecting data:

  1. Start a NEW Claude session (hooks don''t apply to current session)

  2. Use some skills: /plan, /commit, /techdebt

  3. Run /darwin status again
