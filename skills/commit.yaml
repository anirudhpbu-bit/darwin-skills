description: Smart conventional commits with context. Use when user asks to commit
  changes, save work, create a git commit, push code, or wants help writing a commit
  message with proper conventional format.
modules:
  input: v3
  research: v3
  structure: v1
  output: v2
  workflow: v2
  validation: v2
anti_patterns:
- Don't commit without checking git status first
- Don't use generic messages like 'update code' or 'fix bug'
- Don't combine unrelated changes in one commit
- Don't skip the scope when it's clear which component changed
- Don't use past tense - use imperative mood (add, fix, not added, fixed)
examples:
- trigger: commit this
- trigger: save my changes
- trigger: create a commit
- trigger: what should the commit message be
- trigger: commit with a good message
core_prompt: '# Smart Commit


  Create a well-crafted conventional commit based on staged changes.


  ## Process


  ### 1. Check Status

  Run `git status` and `git diff --staged` to understand changes.


  ### 2. Analyze Changes

  - What files were modified?

  - What was the nature of the change?

  - Is this a single logical change or multiple?


  ### 3. Determine Commit Type


  | Type | When to Use |

  |------|-------------|

  | `feat` | New feature or capability |

  | `fix` | Bug fix |

  | `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change) |

  | `style` | Formatting, whitespace, missing semicolons |

  | `docs` | Documentation only |

  | `test` | Adding or fixing tests |

  | `chore` | Build, dependencies, config |

  | `perf` | Performance improvement |


  ### 4. Craft Message


  **Format:**

  ```

  type(scope): short description


  [optional body with more detail]


  [optional footer]

  ```


  **Rules:**

  - Subject line: imperative mood, lowercase, no period, max 50 chars

  - Scope: component/area affected (optional but helpful)

  - Body: wrap at 72 chars, explain "what" and "why"


  ## Examples


  ```bash

  # Simple feature

  feat(camera): add video recording capability


  # Bug fix with context

  fix(auth): prevent duplicate login requests


  Race condition occurred when users double-tapped login button.

  Added debounce and disabled state during request.


  # Refactor

  refactor(store): migrate from Redux to Zustand

  ```


  If changes should be split into multiple commits, suggest which files to unstage.
