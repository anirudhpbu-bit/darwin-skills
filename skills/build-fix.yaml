name: build-fix
version: 1.1.4
description: Loop - run build, fix errors, repeat until clean. Use when user asks
  to fix build errors, resolve type errors, make the build pass, fix compilation issues,
  or says "build is broken" or "fix the errors".
modules:
  input: v2
  research: v2
  structure: v1
  output: v1
  workflow: v2
  validation: v1
anti_patterns:
- Don't use `any` to silence type errors - fix them properly
- Don't delete code just to make errors go away
- Don't ignore the root cause - understand why the error happened
- Don't make behavior-changing fixes without asking
- Don't loop infinitely - stop after 10 iterations or 3 same errors
examples:
- trigger: fix the build
- trigger: build is broken
- trigger: fix type errors
- trigger: make tsc pass
- trigger: resolve compilation errors
- trigger: the build failed, help
core_prompt: '# Build Fix Loop


  Automatically run the build, parse errors, and fix them in a loop until the build
  passes.


  ## Process


  ### 1. Detect Build Command

  Based on project:

  - React Native/Expo: `npx tsc --noEmit`

  - Next.js: `npm run build` or `npx tsc --noEmit`

  - Generic: `npm run build`


  ### 2. Run Build Loop


  - Maximum 10 iterations (prevent infinite loops)

  - If same error persists 3 times, stop and ask for help

  - After each fix, run build again to verify

  - Don''t make changes that could break runtime behavior


  ### 3. Error Categories


  | Error Type | Strategy |

  |------------|----------|

  | Missing import | Add import statement |

  | Type mismatch | Fix type or add assertion |

  | Missing property | Add to interface or fix typo |

  | Unused variable | Remove or prefix with _ |

  | Missing return | Add return statement |


  ## Safety


  - Only fix TypeScript errors, not warnings

  - Preserve existing behavior

  - If uncertain about a fix, ask first
